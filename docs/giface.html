<h1>GIface</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
GIface is a tool that aims to be able to provide an interface for (almost)
every command line you wish to use through a GUI rather than through the command
line.
</p>

<p>
This purpose is accomplished by using the <i>libglade</i> that is altogether
with GTK libs a requirement.
</p>

<p>
From the final user's point of view it is rather easy: someone provides
the interface's description, that is needed by GIface, for a specific
program, while the final user have just to put that description somewhere
and call it through GIface program, that she/he installed somewhere on
its system.
</p>

<p>
So the final users must only digit in a command line something like
<tt>giface /path/to/interfacename.giface</tt>, or rather put this command in a
graphical menu of his/her preferred desktop. (We shall see tips for more
later)
</p>

<p>
Interface writers likely would like to use a graphical GUI Designer like
Glade in order to create the interface file, but being a <q>simple</q>
XML file, they could make it by hands if they are not scared about. In
anycase it is the <i>interface developer</i> who have to know all the
details about GIface.
</p>

<p>
At the third level stay the programmers who want to make this tool better.
However I hope this is useful in someway.
</p>

<h2><a name="final">GIface for final users</a></h2>

<h3><a name="installing">Installing GIface</a></h3>

<p>
This tools is born on GNU/Linux and should work on a lot of UNIX flavours,
but I did not any effort for portability. Theoretically it could work
on Windows too, since GTK lib exist also there. Anyway the following
instructions are mainly for GNU/Linux and UNIX systems.
</p>

<p>
Let us suppose <b>you already have the executable</b>. All you as administrator
of your system must do is to put it where the system can find it. Common
directories are <tt>/usr/bin</tt> or better <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>.
If you have not administrator privileges, you can put it inside your
home's bin, something like <tt>/home/username/bin</tt>. You should
be able to locate it through the <tt>$HOME</tt> environmental variable.
</p>

<p>
Then you can use it simply writing in a shell something like:
</p>

<pre>
$ giface a_program_interface.giface
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
$ giface a_program_interface.giface a_program_interface.desc
</pre>

<p>
(The syntax will be explained later.)
</p>

<p>
It's likely you will prefer to call GIface using the provided Bash script
(inside the directory <tt>script</tt>).
Just put it too inside an executables path (see the env. var. <tt>$PATH</tt>
to know where your system locates the executables).
</p>

<p>
There are not preferred places for the interface files. You put them
somewhere, and the pass their full path to GIface, and GIface will do the
rest. In anycase an administrator could like to put them all inside a
directory, e.g. <tt>/usr/local/share/giface</tt>. Then the script can be
customized so that you can specify just the name of the program as its
argument and everything will go fine. You need to set the
<tt>GIFACE_IF_PATH</tt> env. variable. You will still be able to call
a interface not in that path specifying an absolute or explicitly
relative path as argument to
the script, or just calling GIface directly (since some <i>smoothing</i>
is done by the script).
</p>

<p>
Hopefully some good guy will have created a package, like .deb or .rpm,
so that installing GIface will be as easy as double-clicking on that
file from your preferred file manager.
</p>

<p>
After that, you just must wait for interfaces to come.
</p>



<h3><a name="compiling">Compiling GIface</a></h3>

<p>
You can try even though you are not a programmer. On GNU/Linux it's very
likely you have the GCC compiler installed. When you have installed your
GNU/Linux system through a graphical installer, hope you have put all the
<tt>devel</tt> packages. You need just few of them, but I won't list
those here. Just go and install those strange devel packages right now, your
probability of success will greatly increase!
</p>

<p>
If you compiled by yourself the Linux kernel and almost all the tools on
your GNU/Linux box, or if you usually do not use a graphical installer
tool (or tool like apt-get) skip this part, you know already what you have
to do.
</p>

<p>
Now, put the <tt>.tar.gz</tt> file you have downloaded somewhere, and
<q>open</q> a shell (living on a GNU/Linux or UNIX box means knowing what a shell
is and how to run it). Say you have put the tar.gz into <tt>/usr/local/src</tt>
(to do so you should be root, even though here I am thinking that common
users can write in that directory... if it is not the case just be
root and change all $ into #); if you are reading this you have already
de-tar-gzipped this file, but maybe you are doing so automatically from your
file manager and gone swiftly into the <tt>docs</tt> dir to read
this &mdash;that was a good idea.</p>

<p>
Now try the following lines.
</p>

<pre>
/usr/local/src$ tar -xzf giface-1.0.tar.gz
/usr/local/src$ cd giface-1.0
/usr/local/src/giface-1.0$ ./configure
</pre>

<p>
You will see a little bit of output. If everything's fine, i.e. if you
do not read some error message at the end of the job, then you are ready
for the next simple step.
</p>

<pre>
/usr/local/src/giface-1.0$ make
</pre>

<p>
If you don't see any error message, you have just compiled GIface. Now
you have to install it! If you want to put it in some system-wide bin
directory, you must become root and type
</p>

<pre>
/usr/local/src/giface-1.0$ make install
</pre>

<p>
Now theoretically you can delete the <tt>giface-1.0</tt> directory
(and the tar.gz file too). Or rather you can decide to keep the
directory (try a <tt>make clean</tt> to clean it).
</p>

<p>
There's a another way. If you want to install this program in your home
directory, you will call <tt>configure</tt> adding the
option <tt>--prefix /home/yourhome</tt> and the next steps are the same.
This should work.
</p>

<p>
GIface is not a complex program nor indeed it is thought to be very
portable... You can try to compile it <q>directy</q> with
</p>

<pre>
$ gcc giface.c -o giface `pkg-config libglade-2.0 --libs --cflags` -export-dynamic
</pre>

<p>
This works if you have the <tt>pkg-config</tt> (very likely), all
set up properly (that is almost sure on all graphically installed GNU/Linux
system), the -devel packages installed and can cause some portability
problem on other UNIX/UNIX-like systems &mdash;if noone has fixed this!
(You can be lucky and everything could have been gone OK!)
</p>

<p>
Once this worked, just copy the <tt>giface</tt> executable and the
script (in the dir script) where your
system can locate them.
</p>



<h3><a name="calling">Calling GIface</a></h3>

<p>
This program is almost experimental and uses two syntax. One is simply
</p>

<pre>
giface INTERFACE.giface
</pre>

<p>(where the extension is not mandatory
.giface), where indeed INTERFACE.giface is none but a glade XML file
renamed (provided by some interface writer). The other one is
</p>

<pre>
giface INTERFACE.giface INTERFACE.desc
</pre>

<p>
for most complex behaviour of the interface. So in certain case an interface
is made up of two separate files (I call this a level-2 interface).
If you do not specify the second file for a level-2 interface, the interface
won't work!
</p>

<p>
Interface writers, according to their needs can provide a level-2 interface
or a level-1 interface. The latter is the one that needs just a single
file, i.e. the glade XML file.
</p>

<p>
This is quite <i>cumbersome</i>, I know. The only way to keep the two
files together is to put them into an archive... Then the giface source
code should handle the decompression and so on... As fast solution to
this problem I've implemented another <q>path</q>: the use of a script,
<tt><b>xgiface</b></tt>, that allows level-2 interface writers to put
the files inside an archive; indeed it also allows level-1 interface
writers to compress the glade XML file (that could be rather big,
say, about 50 kBytes or more)
</p>

<p>
So <b>the final user <i>should</i> always use the <tt>xgiface</tt>
script!</b>. It's use is easy.
</p>

<pre>
xgiface lame
</pre>

<p>
This will load <tt>$GIFACE_IF_PATH/lame.giface</tt> if the env. var.
<tt>GIFACE_IF_PATH</tt> exist and is not void. If the file does not
exist, it will try the current directory. If this fails too, it stops
with an error.
</p>

<p>
If it finds the file, it will check if it is a single file compressed,
a single file uncompressed, or an archive. In the first and third
case it needs to decompress/dearchive it somewhere. It will
decompress/dearchive it in the <tt>/var/tmp/giface</tt> dir (that will
be created) by default. To override this setting, set the
<tt>GIFACE_TMP_DIR</tt> to somewhere you (common user)
have write/read permission. After that, it will run GIface properly.
</p>

<p>
In order to reach its aims <tt>xgiface</tt> needs the following
common GNU/Linux tools: <tt>file</tt> (and a <q>Magic</q> descriptor that
recognizes tar.gz, gz and zip), <tt>zip</tt>, <tt>tar</tt>, <tt>gzip</tt>.
</p>


<h3><a name="lastthing">Last tricky thing</a></h3>

<p>
Both level-1 and level-2 interface writers must tell GIface where the
command line tool they wrote the interface for is. They can <q>relax</q>
simply <q>communicating</q> GIface the bare name, e.g. <tt>lame</tt>.
But what if in this way GIface for some reason is not able to locate
the executable?! (id est the shell cannot reach it for some reason).
You can override the interface writer settings with the <tt>-e</tt>
option. E.g.
</p>

<pre>
xgiface lame -e /usr/local/bin/lame
</pre>

<p>
If your interface file is not in the <tt>GIFACE_IF_PATH</tt>, you can
force <tt>xgiface</tt> to load it specifying an absolute path
(a path starting with a <tt>/</tt>) or an <i>explicit</i> relative path
(starting with a <tt>./</tt> or <tt>../</tt>), or a path containing
at least one <tt>/</tt> (that can not be part of the name of the
description file, so its a clue about the real essence of what the
user's written)
</p>

<pre>
xgiface ./lame
</pre>

<p>
Loads the interface in <tt>./lame.giface</tt> (or <tt>./lame</tt>)
rather than that in <tt>$GIFACE_IF_PATH/lame.giface</tt>. Similar
is
</p>

<pre>
xgiface testinterfaces/lame
</pre>

<p>
Using relative paths when you bind the execution to a menu of a desktop's
panel is not a good idea.
</p>

<h2><a name="if">GIface for interface writers</a></h2>


<h3><a name="gipreface">Preface</a></h3>

<p>
There are two different kinds of interface a guy can provide. One I call
it level-1 interface and it is the simpler. The other one I call it
level-2 interface and it uses an extra file for some smooth settings
a command line program can need interfacing with the interface...
</p>

<p>
The approach are a little bit different, so you should choose before you
start. In any case remember that a level-1 interface can be enhanced
easily to the level-2, but a level-2 could not be degraded simply to
a level-1 interface.
</p>


<h3><a name="desc">How to describe interfaces</a></h3>

<p>
GIface uses libglade, so the interface description is a glade XML file.
Theoretically you can write it by hand, but more likely you prefer to use
the GUI Designer Glade.
</p>

<p>
For future enhancement and for some special case that could be a need
for some command line programs, you can create a so called level-2 interface,
this means that altogether with the glade XML file you must create and
edit a proper description file we shall see later &mdash;and so we shall
understand why we need it sometimes.
</p>


<h4><a name="level1">Level-1 interfaces</a></h4>

<p>
In this kind of interfaces the names (ids) you give to the widgets are
important. It is through the names and some convention we shall see later
that GIface can compose the command line that then will be executed.
</p>

<p>
Some options to GIface can be provided through invisible widgets, i.e.
widgets that are not displayed. You can put those widget e.g. in
a dialog that won't be mapped (shown).
</p>

<p>
A GTK Entry widget named <q>commandname</q> is mandatory and holds
the name of the executable.
</p>

<p>
The conventions on the widget naming allow you to associate a specific
widget with an option; some conventions altogether with provided functions
of GIface allow you to give special
capabilities to the interface without feeling to need more than Glade.
</p>

<p>
Widgets the content of which must be simply put in the command line
without leading option must have names starting with <tt>void_</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Widgets the textual content of which (typically a GTK Entry but Spin buttons
for numeric values or combo work too) must be put in the command line
with a leading option must have names starting with <tt>text_</tt>.
The rest of the name must be the option itself, e.g. <tt>text_-t</tt>
put a <tt>-t</tt> in front of the textual content of the widget that has
that name.
</p>

<p>
For switch options, i.e. options that can be handled with a radio buttons
group or with a checkbox, the name of those widgets must start with
<tt>opt_</tt>.
</p>

<p>
There's another convention. If you have a Gtk Entry named e.g.
<tt>void_input</tt> the content of which can
be modified or set by a File Chooser, then the <i>linked</i>
file chooser widget must be called <tt>input_filechooser</tt>. Typically
the <tt>clicked</tt> event of the OK button of the file chooser
call the <tt>giface_update_entry</tt> handler on the relative entry
object (e.g. <tt>void_input</tt>), which then finds its file chooser by name
and updates its content.
</p>

<p>
The last convention is for <i>activator</i>, i.e. <q>toggler</q> (checkbox
or similar) that can be used to ghost (make insensitive) some option.
Insensitive option widgets are ignored even though hold a value. For
example, if you want to activate/deactivate a option or group of
option, you hear for toggle event on a checkbox, and call the
<tt>giface_toggle_active</tt> with the object that you want to toggle,
e.g. <tt>text_-b</tt>. Then, your checkbox's name must be
<tt>activator_-b</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Using activator can mean some option's name overlaps. This cannot be
since widget name must be unique; in these case you can add underscores
just after the prefix (text_ or whatever). So two different widgets
bringing the same <tt>-b</tt> option can exist if one is named
<tt>text_-b</tt> and the other one <tt>text__-b</tt>.
<span alert>FIXME</span>: if an option of a program is e.g.
<tt>-take_it</tt>, it happens GIface takes <tt>it</tt> as option
since it searches for last underscore! Hope your program has no this
kind of option, or if you are a programmer you can fix it.
</p>

<p>
That's almost you have to know about level-1 interfaces: the rest is
a little bit of Glade ability and fantasy, but this argument
is not covered here.
</p>


<h5><a name="gifaceh">GIface handler you can/must use</a></h5>

<dl class="desc">
  <dt>giface_emit_commandline</dt>
  <dd>
    This outputs the forged command line to the standard input. Can be
    used for debugging purpose or for other reasons. You can associate
    this handler to a <tt>clicked</tt> event of a OK button or something
    like that.
  </dd>
  <dt>giface_execute_commandline</dt>
  <dd>
    This executes the forged command line.
  </dd>
  <dt>giface_update_entry</dt>
  <dd>
    You likely associate this handler to the <tt>clicked</tt> event of
    a OK button of a file chooser, acting on the widget entry you want
    to update; if the updating entry is <tt>prefix_name</tt> then
    the file chooser id must be <tt>name_filechooser</tt>. At least
    one underscore <b>must</b> exist before the name part.
  </dd>
  <dt>giface_toggle_active</dt>
  <dd>
    You likely associate this handler to the <tt>toggled</tt> event
    of a toggle button (radio buttons, checkboxs and maybe others),
    the target object being the widget/group you want to make sensitive
    or insensitive according to the status of its activator. If
    the group/widget name is <tt>prefix_name</tt>, the activator
    name must be <tt>activator_name</tt>. At least one underscore
    <b>must</b> exist before the name part.
  </dd>
</dl>


<h5><a name="gifaceo">Glade widget you can/must provide</a></h5>

<dl class="desc">
  <dt>commandname</dt>
  <dd>
    GIface looks at this widget's name to read in the command name. This
    must be a GtkEntry. You can make it always unmapped or show it
    altogether with a dialog so that the user can see it. This
    is <b>mandatory</b> for level-1 interfaces.
  </dd>
  <dt>giface_showoutput</dt>
  <dd>
    This must be a toggle (as a checkbox) and says if GIface must show
    you the output in a specific window or not. Default is no (silent).
    The output is not sent to default stdout, but it is put inside a
    window with scroller and so on.
  </dd>
  <dt>giface_interactive</dt>
  <dd>
    This says to GIface that the program can be interactive (it is a
    toggle). In this
    case we need a console; the output then is sent to the console and
    the input is read from it... All is exactly as if you called the
    program from the command line. This can not work if there's no
    a input stream set for the GIface itself. This can happen when you
    put the calling in a desktop menu. Default to no interaction.
  </dd>
</dl>


<h4><a name="level2">Level-2 interfaces</a></h4>

<p>Coming soon!</p>

<p>
They must exist since the way level-1 interfaces interact with the
building of the commandline is limited and sometimes you need more
control, e.g. an option must come before another one, or an option
must be the first... then the way level-1 interface avoid name
conflicts imposes other limits... and so on.
</p>

<p>
A level-2 interface should consist of two file. One that describes
the interface (the glade XML file), and the other one that <q>points</q>
to the names of the widget and associate to them an option and more
info if needed, like forced position, precedence, and maybe more.
</p>

<p>
So the interfaces creators, when dealing with glade, do not need to
use special convention about widgets names. Special <q>links</q>
(as that that makes it possible to update a specific entry getting
the value from a file chooser) can be set in the option description file.
</p>

<p>
I've thought about it as a key file (so that you can use the <b>glib</b>
to handle it!) divided into sections, each section name according to
a widget, and keys describe how this widget holds the option and how
this option should be put in the command line.
</p>



<h4><a name="problems">Known problems</a></h4>

<dl class="el">
  <dt>SpinButtons (and other) gives 0/min value (wrong values)</dt>
  <dd>
    If you put a widget inside a page of a notebook and you never
    show the page containing it, that widget can give wrong default
    values. E.g. if you have a spin buttons that should hold 128 in
    a page of a notebook and you emit/execute the command line without
    showing that page, you will obtain 16 (the minimum chosen for this
    spin) instead of 128, as if the
    default value is not set until the widget is shown at least once.
  </dd>
